## History

This project was started at EmpowerHack 2015 in November. A first draft of an android app was created at this hackathon which can be found here: https://github.com/empowerhack/Hababy-App

The project was then picked up by a new team at EmpowerHack 2016 in April, who redesigned the app by creating personas, storyboards, and prototypes (the digital prototype is included in this repository). The team also started on a new native Android application, which can be found in this repository. In the future, the team would like to combine the old and new apps.
